<!-- <!DOCTYPE>: It defines the document type or it instruct the browser about the version of HTML. current version is html5 ie known as !DOCTYPE. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers. browser that support html5 are : chrome, firefox, safari, opera, internet explorer/ edge-->

<!-- HTML :  stands for HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE 
a) HYPERTEXT : 
 Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage or the same page (eg. BACK TO TOP), you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.

b) MARKUP LANGUAGE : 
A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <h1> and many others.

c) HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. Html is used to structured the web
Pages. 

d) With HTML you can create your own Website. 

e) Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

  <!-- The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.

    The HTML <head> Element
    The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
    
    HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
    
    Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information. -->
  <head>
    <!-- To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use. -->
    <!-- <meta> it is the information  -->
    <!-- The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below). 


 META TAG Attributes  <meta "attributes-type">   :

 below is the different types of attributes using inside meta tags

Attribute        	  Value             	Description
a) charset	            character_set	      Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document

b) content	            text	              Specifies the value associated with the http-equiv   

or                                 name attribute


c) http-equiv	        content-security-policy
                    content-type
                    default-style
                    refresh	            Provides an HTTP header for the information/value of the content  
                    
                    attribute

d) name	              application-name    Specifies a name for the metadata
author
description
generator
keywords
viewport	


Global Attributes
The <meta> tag also supports the Global Attributes in HTML.

More Examples
Define keywords for search engines:

<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
Define a description of your web page:

<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials for HTML and CSS">
Define the author of a page:

<meta name="author" content="John Doe">
Refresh document every 30 seconds:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

Setting the Viewport
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
1.0 means 100%
2.0 means 200%

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:

    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <!-- The web browser displays the alphabets, numbers and some other symbols correctly. This is all possible because of the required character set that web browser uses. The character set or character encoding has different character encoding standards which assign some numbers to these character set which can be used in the internet. 

ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ANSII) created this character encoding. This character encoding are used in C/C++ programming. It has 128 alphanumeric characters consisting of alphabets(A-Z) and (a-z) and some special symbols like + – * / ( ) @ etc.

ANSI(Windows-1252): American National Standards Institute (ANSI) created character encoding supported 256 characters. It is used as default character set in Microsoft Windows. 

ISO-8859-1: It is used as default character set of HTML4 and also supports 256 characters. The International Standards Organization (ISO) defines the standard character sets for different alphabets/languages. It contains numbers, upper and lowercase English letters, and some special characters. 


UTF-8: UTF-8 and UTF-16 standards was developed by Unicode Consortium, because the ISO-8859 character-sets are limited, and not compatible a multilingual environment. It consists all the character and punctuation symbols. 

Attribute: Web browser must know the character encoding standard used in the html page and this we do as given below. 

Examples: 

HTML4 

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1">
HTML5 

<meta charset="UTF-8">
NOTE: The first values from 0 to 127 are considered as the "Standard" ASCII character set.
      Characters with values from 128 to 255 are the "Extended" Character set. -->

    <!-- The HTML charset Attribute
The character set is specified in the <meta> tag: here meta tag is used for storing information.

different types of charset are :
a) utf-8
b) ascii
c) ansi
d) others...

Example
<meta charset="UTF-8">
The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set.

UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!

Full UTF-8 Reference

The ASCII Character Set
ASCII was the first character encoding standard for the web. It defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet:

English letters (A-Z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < >.
The ANSI Character Set
ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set:

Identical to ASCII for the first 127 characters
Special characters from 128 to 159
Identical to UTF-8 from 160 to 255
<meta charset="Windows-1252">
The ISO-8859-1 Character Set
ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.

Identical to ASCII for the first 127 characters
Does not use the characters from 128 to 159
Identical to ANSI and UTF-8 from 160 to 255
HTML 4 Example
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1">
HTML 5 Example
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
The UTF-8 Character Set
is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127
Does not use the characters from 128 to 159
Identical to ANSI and 8859-1 from 160 to 255
Continues from the value 256 to 10 000 characters

It is used to specify the character encoding used in the HTML document.

Character encoding means : 
What is encoding and decoding in a computer?

Encoding and decoding are used in many forms of communications, including computing, data communications, programming, digital electronics and human communications. These two processes involve changing the format of content for optimal transmission or storage.

In computers, encoding is the process of putting a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, and certain symbols) into a specialized format for efficient transmission or storage. Decoding is the opposite process -- the conversion of an encoded format back into the original sequence of characters.

These terms should not be confused with encryption and decryption, which focus on hiding and securing data. (We can encrypt data without changing the code or encode data without deliberately concealing the content.)


UTF-8 is the most commonly used character encoding.

The speed and performance of a website are improved by reducing the size of the HTML file.The value “utf-8” is required to be placed in lowercase which means it is case-sensitive.

Setting the Viewport
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
1.0 means 100%
2.0 means 200%

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:
