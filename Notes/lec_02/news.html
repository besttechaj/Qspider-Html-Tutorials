    <!-- The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define HTML headings.

      <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
      
      Note: Only use one <h1> per page - this should represent the main heading/subject for the whole page. Also, do not skip heading levels - start with <h1>, then use <h2>, and so on. -->

    <!-- The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
Syntax 
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">

The src Attribute
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

Note: When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:
-->
    <!-- 
img tag are also known as Empty tag since there is no closing tag  -->

    <img src="./images/sport1.jpg" alt="sports_img" />
    <!-- The <p> tag defines a paragraph.

      Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each <p> element. -->

      T20I match at Wankhede Stadium, in Mumbai on December 10, 2023 | Photo
      Credit: ANI The dust has settled down on the WPL auction, but women’s
      cricket continues to fascinate this great metropolis. A big crowd turned
      up for the third final T20I at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday. It might
      have been a dead rubber, England having taken a 2-0 lead, but the Women in
      Blue gave their fans something to cheer about finally.
      <!-- The <br> tag inserts a single line break.

      The <br> tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.
      
      The <br> tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag. 
    
      Tips and Notes
Note: Use the <br> tag to enter line breaks, not to add space between paragraphs.

      India chased down England’s modest 126 with five wickets and an over to
      spare. Finding her feet India’s reply was led by Smriti Mandhana (48, 48b,
      5x4, 2x6), who at last found her form, after her twin failures in the
      series. Though she got out when just 15 was required, she had done enough.
      After Shafali Verma fell early — she exposed her stumps and was castled by
      Freya Kemp — Smriti added 57 for the second wicket with Jemimah Rodrigues
      (29, 33b, 4x4) to put the innings back on the rails.

      First T20I Between India And South Africa Washed Out Without Toss Due To
      Rain 2nd T20I will be played on Tuesday© AFP India's desire to start the
      process of finding an ideal combination for the T20 World Cup 2024
      suffered a minor dent as their first match against South Africa was
      abandoned without a ball being bowled after persistent rain in Durban on
      Sunday. In fact, even the toss did not take place. Now, the 'Men in Blue'
      are left with just five T20Is - two more against the Proteas and three
      games against Afghanistan at home in January - ahead of next year's
      showpiece in the West Indies and the USA.
